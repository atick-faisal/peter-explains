## How to Use This Pile of Junk (Peter Explains Linux Edition)

Alright, so you actually installed this thing. Big whoop. If you think it'll be as enjoyable as a root canal, you're probably right. But hey, here's how to actually use it:

### The Basics (For Those as Slow as Chris)

To get an explanation for a Linux command, type `peter` followed by the command name. Like this:

```bash
 $ peter grep
```

This will spit out some text that kinda-sorta explains what the `grep` command does, with a healthy dose of insults and comparisons to things even dumber than you are.

### Getting Fancy (For Overachievers)

Saw linux command and wanna know what it does. Wrap it with those `" "` thingies after `peter`:


```bash
$ peter "sudo rm -rf /"
```

### Getting Help
Use `--help` to display a list of all these amazing features (and to re-read the insults I wrote for ya).

```bash
$ peter --help
```

### Examples (Because Even I Can't Mess These Up)

-   **Explaining a Command _Without_ Any Arguments:**

    !!! example "Get Explanation for `ls`"
        ``` bash
        $ peter ls
        ```
        That gonna give you something like this:
        ```
        Purpose:
        Ya, this one shows ya what's in a folder, if ya can make heads or tails of its weird output.

        Syntax:
        ls [options] [folder]

        Options:
        * -a: Shows ya all the files, even the ones that are hiding like sneaky lil' weasels.
        * -l: Details, details... gives ya more info than ya probably care about.

        Examples:
        * ls: Hey Lois, check this out! It's like an inventory of what's in this folder.
        * ls -a: Look Lois, it even found my secret stash of chocolate chip cookies! Where'd they come from?
        * ls /home/peter: Lois, quit hiding my bowling ball! I can see it right here in my home folder.
        ```

-   **Explaining a Command _With_ Any Arguments:**

    !!! example "Get Explanation for `sudo rm -rf /`"

        ```bash
        $ peter "sudo rm -rf /"
        ```
        And you get something like...
        ```
        Command: sudo rm -rf /

        Purpose:
        Oh my giddy aunt! This here command's gonna obliterate everything on your computer! It's like nuking your house to get rid of that pesky spider.

        Breakdown:
        * sudo: This tells your computer, 'Listen up, I'm the boss, do what I say.' It's like usin' your 'rents' credit card.
        * rm: This is the wrecking ball, the 'get rid of it' command.
        * -rf: These flags tell 'rm' to go crazy, like a Tasmanian devil on steroids. '-r' means recursive, diggin' into every nook and cranny, and '-f' means force, no askin' for permission.
        * /: This little fella means the root directory, the big boss of all directories. It's like sayin', 'Delete everythin' from the top down.'
        ```

### Disclaimer (So You Don't Sue This Idiot)

I ain't responsible if this tool actually teaches you anything. Well, maybe you'll learn that I'm even dumber than you when it comes to this Linux stuff. And hey, if it blows up your computer, tough luck. You shoulda known better than to trust this thing in the first place.

**Now go on, try it out! See if you can figure out some of those complicated commands that have been hauntin' your nightmares (or maybe just how to delete this whole mess from your system).**

Let me know if you want me to include specific, tailored examples for common Linux commands!
