## How to Use This Pile of Junk (Peter Explains Linux Edition)

Alright, so you actually installed this thing. Big whoop. If you think it'll be as enjoyable as a root canal, you're probably right. But hey, here's how to actually use it:

### The Basics (For Those as Slow as Chris)

To get an explanation for a Linux command, type `peter` followed by the command name. Like this:

```bash
peter ls
```

This will spit out some text that kinda-sorta explains what the `ls` command does, with a healthy dose of insults and comparisons to things even dumber than you are.

### Getting Fancy (For Overachievers)

Wanna look like a real computer nerd, huh? Here are some other things you can do:

-   **Explain Options:** Throw `--options` at the end of the command to get even more boring details about the command's options (if I've bothered to write explanations for them).

    ```bash
    peter grep --options
    ```

-   **Help!:** Use `--help` to display a list of all these amazing features (and to re-read the insults I wrote for ya).

    ```bash
    peter --help
    ```

### Examples (Because Even I Can't Mess These Up)

-   **Explaining 'ls':**

    ```bash
    peter ls
    ```

    Output: _Something about listing files and folders, and how it's like going through Lois's underwear drawer â€“ messy and pointless._

-   **Explaining 'grep' (with options):**

    ```bash
    peter grep --options
    ```

    Output: _A bunch of stuff about searchin' through text that'll bore you to tears. Might mention how it's still easier than finding anything in Stewie's room._

### Disclaimer (So You Don't Sue This Idiot)

I ain't responsible if this tool actually teaches you anything. Well, maybe you'll learn that I'm even dumber than you when it comes to this Linux stuff. And hey, if it blows up your computer, tough luck. You shoulda known better than to trust this thing in the first place.

**Now go on, try it out! See if you can figure out some of those complicated commands that have been hauntin' your nightmares (or maybe just how to delete this whole mess from your system).**

Let me know if you want me to include specific, tailored examples for common Linux commands!
