## Installing Peter Explains (For Dummies)

Alright folks, if you wanna get this hot mess of a tool onto your computer, pay attention. It shouldn't be harder than setting up a VCR (but then again, who even uses those anymore?).

### Prerequisites

-   **Brain (Sort Of):** You don't need to be a genius to install this thing, but a basic understanding of computers is helpful. If you think a terminal is a bus station, you might wanna brush up on your skills first.
-   **Python (The Real Kind):** This tool ain't written in the language of snakes, it's made with Python. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Don't know how to check? Google it, even Meg can figure that out.
-   **PIP (The Package Thingy):** PIP is what helps you install all sorts of fancy Python packages, and you'll need it to get this project workin'. Don't worry, it usually comes bundled with Python.

### Installation Steps

#### Option 1: Using pip (For Those Who Like Things Simple)

1. **Open Your Terminal:** This is the scary black box where you type stuff. If you ain't never used one before, good luck, you're gonna need it.
2. **Run This Magical Command:** Type the following, then hit Enter:

    ```bash
    $ pip install peter-explains
    ```
    This tells PIP to fetch the 'peter-explains' package and install it for ya. Ain't technology amazing?
3. **Set the API Key:** Get one o those for free from [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/). The run:
``` bash
$ peter --api <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

!!! warning
    ### Retep is gonna ruin your day if you try to use it without the API KEY
   
        Don't worry. Meg's here to help. You need a FREE Google Gemini API KEY.
   
        - Get yours from here: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/](https://aistudio.google.com/app/)
        - Save the `API KEY` to your Environment by running the following:
   
          $ peter --api <YOUR_API_KEY>

!!! tip
    If yo dumbass scews up setting the API key, run the following to delete it and try setting it up again.
    ``` bash
    $ peter --delete-api
    $ peter --api <YOUR_CORRECT_API_KEY>
    ```

#### Option 2: From Source (For Masochists)

1. **Fork and Clone (GitHub Stuff):** If you're a glutton for punishment, head to GitHub, fork the repository for this project, and clone it. You'll need Git for this.
2. **Installin' Time:** Navigate to your cloned directory in your terminal, then run this:

    ```bash
    $ pip install .
    ```

### Test It Out (See If It Actually Works)

Now for the moment of truth. Type the following into your terminal:

```bash
 $ peter --help
```

If you see a bunch of help text (and likely some insults from me), then congrats, you've installed it! If you get errors, well... maybe this thing ain't for you after all.

### Important Note for API Keys

Don't forget, you'll need a fancy-pants API key from wherever you're gettin' your LLM stuff. You'll need to set that up as an environment variable: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/](https://aistudio.google.com/app/) before this tool will really work. Don't come cryin' to me if you skip this part.

## Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong, As They Probably Will)

-   **"I Don't Get It..."** Don't worry, most of us don't. Read the README file (if it even exists). You might stumble upon the answer.
-   **"It's Still Broken!"** Did you try turning it off and on again? Okay, in all seriousness, try searching the GitHub issues on the project's page. Someone else probably messed up the same way you did.
-   **"I Found a Bug!"** Ugh, like a freakin' cockroach in the kitchen. Well, report it on GitHub, and maybe someone smarter than you can fix it (that shouldn't be hard to find).

    **That's it! If you made it this far, you're either a tech whiz or a glutton for punishment (or both). Now go learn some Linux commands the Peter Griffin way.**
